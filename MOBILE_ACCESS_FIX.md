# üì± Mobile Access Guide

## ‚ùå **Wrong URLs (Don't Use These):**
- `0.0.0.0:3000` - This won't work on mobile
- `localhost:3000` - Only works on the same computer

## ‚úÖ **Correct URLs for Mobile:**

### Option 1: Local Network Access
```
http://10.20.38.218:3000/login
```
- Use this when you're on the same WiFi network as your computer
- Fast and reliable for local testing

### Option 2: Public Access (via Ngrok)
```
https://4af482d17f59.ngrok-free.app/login
```
- Use this from anywhere in the world
- Works on any network (WiFi, mobile data, etc.)

## üß™ **How to Test:**

1. **Open your mobile browser**
2. **Type one of the correct URLs above**
3. **Click "Continue with GitHub"**
4. **Complete GitHub authentication**
5. **You should be redirected back and logged in**

## üîß **If You Still Get Errors:**

1. **Check your WiFi**: Make sure your phone is on the same network as your computer (for local IP)
2. **Use Ngrok URL**: The public URL should work from anywhere
3. **Clear browser cache**: Sometimes mobile browsers cache connection errors

## üìã **Quick Test URLs:**

- **Home Page**: `https://4af482d17f59.ngrok-free.app`
- **Login Page**: `https://4af482d17f59.ngrok-free.app/login`
- **Local Login**: `http://10.20.38.218:3000/login` (same network only)

Try the ngrok URL first - it should work from anywhere! üöÄ
