# ✨ Feature Implementation Summary

## What Was Requested
> "we need to show a pop card when a user likes without signed in."

## What Was Delivered

## How It Works

```
Guest User Flow:
───────────────

1. Click ❤️ on snippet
2. API call → 401 Unauthorized
3. Dialog pops up:
   ┌─────────────────────────┐
   │ ❤️ Sign in to save     │
   │                         │
   │ Benefits:               │
   │ • Sync across devices   │
   │ • Free forever          │
   │                         │
   │ [Maybe Later] [Sign In] │
   └─────────────────────────┘
4. User clicks "Sign In"
5. Redirected to /login
6. User logs in
7. Favorites now save to database ✅
```

## Testing

### Quick Test:
```bash
1. Make sure you're logged out
2. Go to /explore
3. Click any snippet
4. Click the ❤️ heart icon
5. ✅ Dialog should appear!
```

### Logged-In Test:
```bash
1. Login at /login
2. Go to /explore
