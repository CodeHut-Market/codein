# Navigation & Routing Report

## ✅ Fixed Issues

### 1. Client Component Directives
- **Issue**: `app/explore/page.tsx` and `app/profile/page.tsx` were missing proper "use client" directives
- **Fix**: Corrected malformed directives and added proper client-side rendering support

### 2. Import Path Issues
- **Issue**: Navigation component had incorrect import for `RippleThemeToggle`
- **Fix**: Moved component to correct location and fixed import paths

### 3. Component Duplication
- **Issue**: Duplicate `SnippetCard.tsx` files causing import conflicts
- **Fix**: Removed duplicate from `/components` directory, kept version in `/app/components`
